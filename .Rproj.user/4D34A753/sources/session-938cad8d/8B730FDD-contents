For detailed information on how to create a Quarto website, please visit [Quarto's Help Center](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

# Project Files

A Quarto website has:

-   `_quarto.yml` → controls the entire website
-   `.qmd` files → individual pages
-   `images` folder → store images
-   `docs` folder → Github pages access (do not touch the docs folder)
-   `styles.css` → styling specific pages
-   `.gitignore` and `.Rhistory` → not too important, I would not touch
-   `.RData` → data storage
-   `README.md` → general instructions on how to publish website in case you need help later

If something changes across the whole website, edit `_quarto.yml`. If something changes on one page only, edit that page’s YAML.

# Render Website

If you want to preview your website locally, you can either\

-   click render on the top left of RStudio

or

-   go to terminal, and type `quarto preview`

# YAML

``` r
website:
  title: "My Portfolio" # name your website
  navbar: # navigation between pages
    left: # chose where you want your nav bar to be located
      - text: "Home" # the text diplayed
        href: index.qmd # the name of the file linked to the text
      - text: "About Me"
        menu:  # add nested pages
          - text: "My Resume"
            href: about.qmd
          - text: "Political & Environmental Activism"
            href: active.qmd
```

YAML indentation MUST use spaces, not tabs. Indentation defines hierarchy. A misplaced space will cause errors for your site.

Useful advanced options:

-   `draft: true` → hides page from rendering
-   `freeze: auto` → avoids re-running heavy computations
-   `page-layout: full` → removes side margins
-   `page-layout: article` → default blog style

# Styles

To create the CSS File, click File → New File → Text File, and name the file however you like but make sure it ends with styles.css like the one in Owen's template.

To link the styles.css file to a page of your choice, go to the yml code at the top of qmd file and paste the name of your css file

``` r
format:
  html:
    css: cv-styles.css
```

To learn how the css code works you can visit this youtube link:

or visit [Quarto's Website](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)

# Images

Always store images in the images folder.\
To add an image, the easiest way is to first make sure you are in visual mode, then click insert, then click Figure/Image and chose the file on your computer.

# Publish Website

You will need an access token in order to link and publish your Quarto website on Github.

In Github, click Profile picture → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → generate new token

When creating the token,

-   you must click Repository access, then choose "Only selected repositories", and select your website repository

-   click Permissions, then click "Contents: Read and write" and "Metadata: Read-only"

-   click generate token

-   !!Copy the token immediately!! save the token somewhere, once you leave the page, you cannot access the token again.

Go back to RStudio and install the package gitcreds.

Once installed, load the package into your library, and open your R console. Type the following into your console

-   gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

then paste the access token into your console and press enter your github should be linked now

To publish your website, open your terminal and type each line of code below and press enter after each command separately:

-   git init

-   quarto render

-   git remote add origin <https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git>

-   git add -A

-   git commit -m "Update website"

-   git push

If you check your repository on Github, you should see the updated pages, then click the link on the right and you should be able to see your published website

If you want to update your website, then you only need to execute the following commands in your terminal again

-   quarto render

-   git add -A

-   git commit -m "Update website"

-   git push
